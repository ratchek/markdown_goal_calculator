This is a personal tool for calculating how well I followed my weekly schedule.
Basically calculates the weighted sum for total and completed tasks using markdown checkmarks and headers as syntax. 
Works specifically for the type of formatting I follow in my files and doubt it will be useful to anyone else.



## General Syntax
"______" (six underscores) denote file end. Nothing after that will be counted

Each section starts with a "# " (a markdown heading).

## Weights
Each section can have custom weights.
To add specific weights to a section, include "(=5pts)" somewhere in the section header,
but replace the 5 with a desired weight (can use multiple digits)
The default weight, if none is included is 1

## Scoring
Every line starting with an empty markdown checkmark "- [ ] " is counted as a task attempted
but not completed. (Notice the space before the brackets, inside the brackets, and after the brackets)

Every line starting with an filed markdown checkmark "- [x] " is counted as a task successfully completed.
(Notice the space before the brackets, no spaces inside the brackets, and space after the brackets)

If you include a html strike-through tag right after the markdown checkmark "- [ ] <s>",
then the task will not be counted at all.
